I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how to properly prepare yourself for a camping trip!
It's not that difficult to plan a safe and fun camping excursion but you have to do it with plenty of forethought.
Many things can go wrong and while you cannot prepare for EVERYTHING, you can prepare for the most common things, as well as to be flexible.

Step 1.
  The first thing you have to do is decide to camp, and subsequently where and at what time of year. Some places will be more or less accessible or dangerous at certain times of year. Distance from your car (or home), weather, location/terrain, wildlife likely to be present and your general physical fitness all play roles in your decision, as well as the equipment you have (or don't) and it's condition.
